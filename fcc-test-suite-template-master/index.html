          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
            is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
            example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
            its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
            control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
            for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
            for example:
            <code>var x = 42. </code>
          </p>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
             <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

          <h1>Javascript and Java</h1>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and
            basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
            from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          <h1>Hello world</h1>
          <p>
            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
            your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          </p>
          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
          <p>
            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
            browser!
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="variables" class="main-section">
          <h1>Variables</h1>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).

            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
            JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
